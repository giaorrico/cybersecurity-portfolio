- Incident response & threat intelligence
- Python & Bash scripting
- Tools: Wireshark, Metasploit, Nessus, Burp Suite

--------
Projects

1. Analyze network attacks.
   Tools used: Wireshark 
- Performed vulnerability scanning and identify the cause of the service interruption.
- Analyzed results and prepared a detailed vulnerability assessment report.

2. Apply filters to SQL queries.
   Tools used: SQL, Power BI 
- Detected Unauthorized Login Attempts
- Correlated findings across datasets.
- Looked for anomalies like spikes in activity or patterns suggesting insider threats.
- Used visualization tool (Power BI) for deeper insights.

3. Assign Python variables for the number of login attempts.
   Tools used: Python
- Assigned and updated variables, determined their data types, and used Boolean logic to enable efficient and readable code.

4. Create loops.
   Tools used: Python
- Used 'for' loops to repeat a process a specified number of times.
- Used 'while' loops and comparison operators to repeat a process until a specified condition has been met.

5. Import and parse a text file.
   Tools used: Python
- Imported and parsed text files using functions like 'open()' and statements like 'with'.
- Used '.split()' method in Python to convert a string to a list.

6. Develop an algorithm.
   Tools used: Python
- Develop an algorithm in Python that automates a process that connects users to their assigned devices.
- Write a code that indicates if a user is approved on the system and has brought their assigned device to the security team.

7. Security Incident Tracker.
   Tools used: SQL
- Developed a system to log and track security incidents.
- Created a table to log security incidents with details such as description, severity, and status.
- By inserting example incidents, the system demonstrates how to track ongoing issues and filter data (e.g., unresolved 
   incidents).

8. Network Port Scanner.
   Tools used: Python
- Built a Python script to scan open ports on a given host.
- Scanned open ports to identify exposed services that could be exploited by attackers, enabling proactive security hardening.

9. Automation with Python.
   Project: Email Alert System
- Automated alert systems to ensure critical notifications are sent promptly when an anomaly is detected, reducing response 
   times.
- The script connects to an SMTP server, formats an email, and sends an alert to a recipient.
